### User Story

- AS A social media startup

- SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a social network API
- WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
-- THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
-- THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
-- THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
- WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
-- THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list

### Usage

Application users will need Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js (Links to an external site.) and Mongoose (Links to an external site.) packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.
